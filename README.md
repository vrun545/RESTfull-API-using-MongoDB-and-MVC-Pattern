## Overview

Welcome to the "RESTful APIs with ExpressJS and MongoDB - A Complete Guide" project! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to build RESTful APIs using ExpressJS and MongoDB, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a hands-on guide to creating robust RESTful APIs using the popular Node.js framework, ExpressJS, and the NoSQL database MongoDB. The use of the MVC pattern ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, making it easy for developers to understand and extend the functionality.

## Features

- **ExpressJS:** Utilize the power of ExpressJS to create a scalable and efficient server for your RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** Leverage MongoDB for data storage, taking advantage of its flexibility and scalability for handling large datasets.
- **MVC Pattern:** Implement a clean and organized code structure following the Model-View-Controller pattern for better code maintainability and separation of concerns.
- **CRUD Operations:** Learn how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on your MongoDB database through the API.
- **Middleware:** Explore the use of middleware in ExpressJS for handling task logs of Request and Response made to the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- Code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```git
git clone https://github.com/vrun545/RESTfull-API-using-MongoDB-and-MVC-Pattern.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

npm install
```

3. Configure the MongoDB connection in the `connection.js` file.

4. Start the server:

```git
nodemon index.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the API.
